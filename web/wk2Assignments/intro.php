                <h2>Greetings From Chris Cowan</h2>
                <img src="CowanFamTemple.jpg" alt="Cowan Family at Oakland Temple">
                <p>Welcome to my <strong>Web Backend Development II</strong> website!</p>
                <p>
                    My name is Chris Cowan and I am majoring in Web Design and Development at BYU Idaho.
                    I have enjoyed my education here and have learned a tremendous amount in the classes 
                    I have taken so far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below are a few of my interests and things I like to do for fun:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spending time with my family</li>
                    <li>Riding bikes</li>
                    <li>Doing projects around the house</li>
                    <li>Attempting to golf</li>
                    <li>Target shooting</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I am a fairly recent convert to the Church, baptized in September of 2016. I currently serve as
                    a counselor in the Bishopric and love learning more about the gospel. The blessings received
                    through living righteously and receiving sacred ordinances are undeniable and incredible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every semester is a challenge, but I'm looking forward to learning!
                </p>
